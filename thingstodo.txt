Things TODO

Make an analytics program which interprets all these tweets (too bad we don't have a timestamp for most of the data)
	-Search the database for the most popular words (probably names of politicians)
	-Look for all the tweets that have those words
	-Look at the favorability of the tweets that have those words
	-Make lots of graphs that show the net favorability
	-Have a hall of fame.
	-

Tinker with the algorithm a little bit
	-See if I can get multipliers working well
	-add words to the list
	-See if I can eliminate false positives
	-Bayesian machine learning ?? I know a guy has done it. (to try and estimate how right we are..)
	-more than just a one dimensional rating system(+/-)
	- maybe a 2d or three d. This may mean jumping into linguistics a bit
Other Things
	-Try and figure out a way to get a ring buffer going for realtime analysis of tweets
	-Analyze tweets from people who talk about things and then look at who they follow
	 and see if I can create 'communites' or echo chambers 
	 
	 
Create a chron job which can run the tweet harvester in spurts


just a note: I'm getting about 10,000 english language tweets in about 0.5 hours which means about 20,000 an hour

the child actors of modern family have it weird. pretending to be normal kids even though their life does not remotely
resemeble a typical american kid

feel like I'm leveling up a bit in the programming world;
	databases, dictionaries, ring buffers this is a good projcet
	check out the sigmusic page to see how they handled the emotion parsing
