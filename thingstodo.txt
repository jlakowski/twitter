Things TODO

Make an analytics program which interprets all these tweets (too bad we don't have a timestamp for most of the data)
	-Search the database for the most popular words (probably names of politicians)
	-Look for all the tweets that have those words
	-Look at the favorability of the tweets that have those words
	-Make lots of graphs that show the net favorability
	-Have a hall of fame.
	-

Tinker with the algorithm a little bit
	-See if I can get multipliers working well
	-add words to the list
	-See if I can eliminate false positives
	-Bayesian machine learning ?? I know a guy has done it.

Other Things
	-Try and figure out a way to get a ring buffer going for realtime analysis of tweets
	-Analyze tweets from people who talk about things and then look at who they follow
	 and see if I can create 'communites' or echo chambers 
	 
	 
Create a chron job which can run the tweet harvester in spurts


just a note: I'm getting about 10,000 english language tweets in about 0.5 hours which means about 20,000 an hour
