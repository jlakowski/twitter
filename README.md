Scrape tweets from Twitter in java using the twitter4j library

Use some cool, albiet slightly dated research to asign an emotional value to
each tweet. See the SigMusic Tweetbeat project for more of this

Save the tweet and its values and a timestamp into a sqlite database

for anaylitcs see my twitterlytics repo. There is some good stuff in there
